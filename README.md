# OpenTrainER

OpenTrainER is an open source train simulator framework powered by Godot. Lines and vehicles are defined by JSON files imported into the simulator. This allows wide modding support and keeps all asset data outside the simulator.

## Installation

You can download the latest project build [here](https://github.com/lexag/OpenTrainER/releases).

To run, you also need one or more line and vehicle files. Installation instructions can be found [here](about:blank). 

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

### Prerequisites
OpenTrainER runs on Godot 4.2.1 (Although any 4.2.x should work fine) [Download Godot](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/#4.2.1)
